                <p>Roberto Petroli, Italian clarinetist, was born in Bari.</p>

                <p>He studied and graduated with distinction at the Conservatory "A. Vivaldi" in Alessandria where he spent his youth.</p>
                <p>After winning several national and international music competitions, he received two scholarships which allowed him to continue his studies in Paris with Guy Deplus and in London with Antony Pay.</p>
                <p>
                    A very important moment in his musical life, one which is characterized by his love for classical music as well as jazz, has been the encounter with the Maestro Hengel Gualdi, who became his teacher and friend.<br>
                    From 1988 to 1992 he played side-by- side with his mentor's Orchestra and had the pleasure to partner with some of the great Jazz artists: Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan.</p>
                <p>In 1993 he dedicates his time to learn the technique of arrangement and composition in addition to his musical performances.</p>
                <p>Roberto Petroli has played with many musicians: Lucio Dalla, Maurizio Solieri,  Fabio Concato, Eugenio Finardi, Paolo Alderighi, just to name a few. During his long career he has recorded many LPs and CDs and has participated in various TV productions.</p>
                <p>Moving to Switzerland in 2009, he started his new musical venture as the musical partner of the italian song writer Pippo Pollina, who is himself based in Zurich. They have been touring in  Europe ever since 2011 as a duo, trio and as a quintet. </p>
                <p>His exposure to the new music environment has also brought him in contact with musicians such as Konstantin Wecker, Giorgio Conte, Eve Gallagher, Daniel Küffer, Jean Pierre von Dach, Walter Kaiser, Sina, Etta Scollo, Werner Schmidbauer. He has also embarked on the musical scene in St Gallen where he has performed in the the Cole Porter musical  „Anything goes“.</p>
